# Python data processing application
The python data processing application is designed to facilitate the analysis of data relating to people vaccinated against Covid-19. This application is based on the pandas library for reading csv data, Matplotlib for querying data, calculating statistical variables (means, medians, mode, plotting graphs and Tkinter for viewing and setting data to be processed.
